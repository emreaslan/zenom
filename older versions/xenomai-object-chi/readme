README - POSIX Utilities Package, Version 2.2
=============================================
21 January 2006.

TODO:
=====

Changelog 01/21/2006
  . TCPClient: Enabled TCP_NODELAY socket option
  . TCPClient: Enabled timeout (SO_RCVTIMEO)
  . TCPClient/Server: Enabled setting socket buffer sizes (SO_RCVBUF/SO_SNDBUF) 
  . UDPClient/Server: Enabled setting socket buffer sizes (SO_RCVBUF/SO_SNDBUF) 
  . Made changes so that public interface is same for both TCP and UDP client/server.
  . Cleaned up exception handling, especially throwing exception from destructors,
    which was a bad idea.
  
Changelog 07/19/2005
  . UDPClient/Server: init made public
  . UDPClient/Server: sendAndReceive, receiveAndReply made protected.
  . added pthread_testcancel() to while loop.
  . Thread: removed availability of class pointer to enterThread, 
    executeInThread and exitThread functions (this pointer used to
    cause error in derived class implementations since it points
    to a base class. We could use dynamic_cast<>() but that is a 
    bad solution.
  
Changelog for 2.0 (relative to 1.0 (Dec 2004))
  . Renamed NetworkClient and NetworkServer classes to 
    TCPClient and TCPServer, respectively.
  . Fixed a few bugs in TCPServer/TCPClient.
  . Added a cleanup routine to Thread class.
  . Added UDPClient and UDPServer.
  . Provides both static and shared libraries


Problems:
=========
* NetworkClientServer
-> Data corruption may occur with multiple clients over network
